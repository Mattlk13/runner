# Transcriptic Runner

The Transcriptic Runner is a command-line tool for interacting with the
Transcriptic API to submit and analyze protocols.

## Installation

```
$ pip install transcriptic
```

or

```
$ git clone https://github.com/transcriptic/runner.git
$ cd runner
$ pip install .
```

to upgrade to the latest version using pip or check whether you're already up to date: 
```
$ pip install transcriptic --upgrade
```


## Usage

Access help by typing `$ transcriptic --help` or `$ transcriptic [COMMAND] --help`

##### Login to your Transcriptic account
**\*Before using the runner, you'll need to log in to Transcriptic to fetch your
access key information. This will be saved in `~/.transcriptic` for future
commands.**\*

```
$ transcriptic login
Email: sanger@transcriptic.com
Password:
Logged in as sanger@transcriptic.com (cambridge)
```

##### Ititialize a Directory With a `manifest.json` File
The init command creates an empty `manifest.json` file with the proper structure within the current directory.  Read below or [here](https://developers.transcriptic.com/v1.0/docs/the-manifest) to find out more about what a manifest does.   Command will prompt to overwrite if your folder already contains a file called `manifest.json`. 
```
$ transcriptic init
```
##### Analyze a Protocol
Submit a protocol to Transcriptic to check its validity.
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic analyze
âœ“ Protocol analyzed
  2 instructions
  1 container
```

##### Submit a Protocol to Transcriptic
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic submit --project "sequencing" --title "Sequencing run"
Run created: https://secure.transcriptic.com/cambridge/sequencing/r1xa043277aekj
```

##### Submit a Protocol to Transcriptic in Test Mode
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic submit --project "sequencing" --title "Sequencing run" --test
```

**See below for using the preview command to preview the Autoprotocol output of a protocol outlined in a manifest.json file**

## Using the Runner with autoprotocol.harness and a `manifest.json` file

The [autoprotocol-python](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python) library helps you generate Autoprotocol with easy to use functions. [autoprotocol.harness](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/blob/master/autoprotocol/harness.py) parses a set of typed input parameters contained in a `manifest.json` file and passes them back to the specified script when you run `transcriptic preview` (see above).  Input types also define protocol browser UI elements on transcriptic's website. 

##### Example
The example below assumes the following file structure:
```
protocols/
  manifest.json
  requirements.txt
  my_protocols/
    __init__.py
    sample_protocol.py
```

A manifest.json file contains metadata about protocols required when uploading a package to Transcriptic. A package can contain many protocols but for our example it will contain just one.  The `"inputs"` stanza defines expected parameter types which translate into the proper UI elements for that type when you upload the package to Transcriptic.  Read more about the manifest file [here](http://developers.transcriptic.com/v1.0/docs/the-manifest).  The preview section serves to provide your script with hard-coded parameters and refs for local testing:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "format": "python",
  "license": "MIT",
  "protocols": [
    {
      "name": "SampleProtocol",
      "command_string": "python -m my_protocols.sample_protocol",
      "description": "this is a sample protocol",
      "inputs": {
        "source_sample": {
          "type": "aliquot",
          "description": "A sample source aliquot",
        },
        "dest_sample": {
          "type": "aliquot",
          "description": "A sample destination aliquot"
        },
        "transfer_vol": {
          "type": "volume",
          "description": "Volume to transfer",
          "default": "12:microliter"
      },
      "preview": {
        "refs": {
          "sample_plate": {
            "type": "96-pcr",
            "discard": true
          }
        },
        "parameters": {
          "source_sample": "sample_plate/A1",
          "dest_sample": "sample_plate/A2",
          "transfer_vol": "5:microliter"
        }
      },
      "dependencies": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is what your `sample_protocol.py` file would look like.  Note that there is no need to declare a Protocol object within the script or print the protocol to standard out, both of these things are taken care of by `autoprotocol.harness`.  **The `protocol_name` parameter in `autoprotocol.harness.run()` must match the name of that protocol within your manifest.json file**:
```python
def sample_protocol(protocol, params):
  protocol.transfer(params["source_sample"],
                    params["dest_sample"],
                    params["transfer_vol"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
  from autoprotocol.harness import run
  run(sample_protocol, protocol_name="SampleProtocol")
```

#### preview the protocol's output on the command line:
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol
```

#### Run a protocol and view its output on the command line by passing it an external .json file with parameters and refs (instead of using your `manifest.json`'s "preview" section):
```
$ transcriptic run SampleProtocol protocol_params.json
```

To submit the resulting protocol to transcriptic or analyze it, pipe that result to `transcriptic submit` or `transcriptic analyze` as above.
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol | transcriptic analyze
```

When you're ready to upload a package to Transcriptic, make sure to include the version of autoprotocol and any other packages you might have used in your `requirements.txt` file:
```
autoprotocol==2.1.0
```

A release consists of everything within the protocols_folder folder **(but do not zip the folder itself: the manifest.json file must be at the top level of the archive.)**
