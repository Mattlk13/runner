# Transcriptic Runner

The Transcriptic Runner is a command-line tool for interacting with the
Transcriptic API.

## Installing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/transcriptic/runner.git
$ cd runner
$ pip install .
```

## Example usage

##### Login to your Transcriptic account
Before using the runner, you'll need to log in to Transcriptic to fetch your
access key information. This will be saved in `~/.transcriptic` for future
commands.

```
$ transcriptic login
Email: sanger@transcriptic.com
Password:
Logged in as sanger@transcriptic.com (cambridge)
```

##### Analyze a protocol 
Submit a protocol to Transcriptic to check its validity.
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic analyze 
âœ“ Protocol analyzed
  2 instructions
  1 container
```

##### Submit a protocol to Transcriptic
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic submit --project sequencing --title "Sequencing run"
Run created: https://secure.transcriptic.com/cambridge/sequencing/r1xa043277aekj
```

## Using the Runner with autoprotocol.harness and a manifest.json file

The [autoprotocol-python](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python) library helps you generate Autoprotocol with easy to use functions. [autoprotocol.harness](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/blob/master/autoprotocol/harness.py) is a tool for parsing a set of typed input parameters from JSON, such as generated by the [Transcriptic Protocols UI](#). The runner can help you test a protocol before submitting it, by passing the preview inputs from your manifest.json to your protocol.

#### Example
The example below assumes the following file structure:
```
protocols/
  manifest.json
  requirements.txt
  my_protocols/
    __init__.py
    sample_protocol.py
```

A manifest.json file contains metadata about protocols required when uploading a package to Transcriptic. A package can contain many protocols but for our example it will contain just one:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "format": "python",
  "license": "MIT",
  "protocols": [
    {
      "name": "SampleProtocol",
      "command_string": "python -m my_protocols.sample_protocol",
      "preview": {
        "refs": {
          "sample_plate": {
            "type": "96-pcr",
            "discard": true
          }
        },
        "parameters": {
          "source_sample": "sample_plate/A1",
          "dest_sample": "sample_plate/A2",
          "transfer_vol": "5:microliter"
        }
      },
      "inputs": {
        "source_sample": "aliquot",
        "dest_sample": "aliquot",
        "transfer_vol": "volume"
      },
      "dependencies": []
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is what your sample_protocol.py file would look like.  Note that there is no need to declare a Protocol object within the script or print the protocol to standard out, both of these things are taken care of by autoprotocol.harness.  The `protocol_name` declared in autoprotocol.harness.run() must match the name of that protocol within your manifest.json file:
```python
def sample_protocol(protocol, params):
  protocol.transfer(params["source_sample"],
                    params["dest_sample"],
                    params["transfer_vol"])
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
  from autoprotocol.harness import run
  run(sample_protocol, protocol_name="SampleProtocol")
```
To preview the protocol's output on the command line: 
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol
```
To submit the resulting protocol to transcriptic or analyze it, pipe that result to submit or analyze as above. 
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol | transcriptic analyze
```
When you're ready to upload a package to Transcriptic, make sure to include the version of autoprotocol and any other packages you might have used in your requirements.txt file:
```
autoprotocol==2.0.1
```

A release consists of everything within the protocols_folder folder (but do not zip the folder itself: the manifest.json file must be at the top level of the archive.)
