# Transcriptic Runner

The Transcriptic Runner is a command-line tool for interacting with the
Transcriptic API.

## Installing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/transcriptic/runner.git
$ cd runner
$ pip install .
```

## Example usage

##### Login to your Transcriptic account
Before using the runner, you'll need to log in to Transcriptic to fetch your
access key information. This will be saved in `~/.transcriptic` for future
commands.

```
$ transcriptic login
Email: sanger@transcriptic.com
Password:
Logged in as sanger@transcriptic.com (cambridge)
```

##### Analyze a protocol 
Submit a protocol to Transcriptic to check its validity.
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic analyze 
âœ“ Protocol analyzed
  2 instructions
  1 container
```

##### Submit a protocol to Transcriptic
```
$ python my_protocol.py | transcriptic submit --project sequencing --title "Sequencing run"
Run created: https://secure.transcriptic.com/cambridge/sequencing/r1xa043277aekj
```

## Using transcriptic.runner with autoprotocol.harness and a manifest.json file

The [autoprotocol-python](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python) library allows you to generate protocols in Autoprotocol with easy to use functions.  [autoprotocol.harness](https://github.com/autoprotocol/autoprotocol-python/blob/master/autoprotocol/harness.py) can be used to pass parameters to those protocols from the preview within a manifest file. 

#### Example
The example below assumes the following file structure:
```
protocols_folder/
  manifest.json
  requirements.txt
  my_protocols/
    __init__.py
    sample_protocol.py
```

A manifest.json file is used in order to upload protocols along with their metadata as a package to secure.transcriptic.com/<your organization>/protocols.  They can contain many protocols but for our example it will contain just one:
```
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "format": "python",
  "license": "MIT",
  "protocols":[{
    "name": "SampleProtocol",
    "command_string": "python -m my_protocols.sample_protocol",
    "preview":{
        "refs":{
          "sample_plate":{
            "type": "96-pcr",
            "discard": true
          }
        },
        "parameters":{
          "source_sample": "sample_plate/A1"
          "dest_sample": "sample_plate/A2"
          "transfer_vol": "5:microliter"
        }
    },
    "inputs": {
      "source_sample": "aliquot",
      "dest_sample": "aliquot",
      "transfer_vol": "aliquot"
    },
    "dependencies": []
  }
  ]
}

```

The following is what your sample_protocol.py file would look like.  Note that there is no need to declare a Protocol object within the script or print the protocol to standard out, both of these things are taken care of by autoprotocol.harness.  The `protocol_name` declared in autoprotocol.harnes.run() must match the name of that protocol within your manifest.json file:
```
def sample_protocol(protocol, params):
  protocol.transfer(params["source_sample"].set_volume("100:microliter"), 
                    params["dest_sample"], params["transfer_vol"])
  
if __name__ == __main__:
  from autoprotocol.harness import run
  run(sample_protocol, protocol_name="SampleProtocol")
```
To preview the protocol's output on the command line: 
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol
```
To submit the resulting protocol to transcriptic or analyze it, pipe that result to submit or analyze as above. 
```
$ transcriptic preview SampleProtocol | transcriptic analyze
```
When you're ready to upload a package to Transcriptic, make sure to include the version of autoprotocol and any other packages you might have used in your requirements.txt file:
```
autoprotocol=2.0.1
```

A release consists of everything within the protocols_folder folder (but do not zip the folder itself, such that the manifest.json file is at the top level of the resulting archive)
